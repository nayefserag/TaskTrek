## Description

TaskTrek is a powerful server-side backend built with NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework. This application leverages the capabilities of NestJS, along with JWT authentication, Express, and Mongoose, to provide a robust foundation for handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations through APIs.

### Key Features

- **NestJS Framework:** TaskTrek is developed using NestJS, which brings a modular and scalable structure to your backend. It follows best practices and design patterns, making it easy to maintain and extend.

- **JWT Authentication:** Secure your APIs with JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication. TaskTrek ensures that only authorized users can access the protected resources, enhancing the overall security of your application.

- **Express:** TaskTrek utilizes Express, a popular web application framework for Node.js, to handle HTTP requests and streamline the development of RESTful APIs.

- **Mongoose:** The application integrates Mongoose, an elegant MongoDB object modeling tool, to interact with the MongoDB database seamlessly. This allows for efficient data storage and retrieval.

- **Swagger Documentation:** The API endpoints in TaskTrek are documented using Swagger, providing a clear and interactive interface for developers to explore and understand the available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.
